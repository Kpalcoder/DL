### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Kamlesh PAl

I'm a passionate Data Scientist and Machine Learning enthusiast with a keen interest in building and optimizing neural networks. I enjoy tackling challenging datasets and leveraging powerful tools to extract meaningful insights and create efficient models.



### ðŸš€ My Featured Project: Fashion MNIST Classification with ANN and Optuna

This project showcases my skills in building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset. To achieve the best possible performance, I utilized the Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework to fine-tune the model's architecture and training parameters.
